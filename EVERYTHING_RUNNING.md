## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. **Explore the API**
```bash
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```
This opens the interactive API documentation. You can test all endpoints here!

### 2. **View the Dashboard**
```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```
The dashboard is loading and will display metrics (currently in development).

### 3. **Test the Health Check**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

## 📝 What's Next?

All import errors have disappeared! 🎉 Docker installed all the dependencies automatically for you.

Now you can:
1. **Implement Features** - Start building out the analysis engines
2. **Write Tests** - Add unit tests for new functionality
3. **Extend the API** - Add new endpoints as needed
4. **Develop the Dashboard** - Build out the React components
