# ✅ Fixing All Import Errors

## 🎯 The Good News

**These errors are NOT code errors!** They're just **missing dependencies**. This is completely normal for a fresh project.

The errors you see are:
- ❌ `Import "fastapi" could not be resolved`
- ❌ `Import "torch" could not be resolved`
- ❌ `Cannot find module 'react'`
- etc.

These disappear once the packages are installed.

## 🔧 How to Fix (Choose One)

### **Option 1: Use Docker (Recommended) ⭐**

Docker automatically installs all dependencies in containers. No manual setup needed!

```bash
cd /Users/srivardhanreddygutta/Projects/AI-code-review-assistant

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env

# Start everything with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 30-60 seconds...
# Then check:
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**That's it!** All dependencies are installed automatically inside the containers.

---

### **Option 2: Manual Setup (If You Don't Have Docker)**

#### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd /Users/srivardhanreddygutta/Projects/AI-code-review-assistant/backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

#### ML Service Setup
```bash
# In a new terminal...
cd /Users/srivardhanreddygutta/Projects/AI-code-review-assistant/ml-service

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run ML service
python -m uvicorn inference_service:app --port 8001 --reload
```

#### Dashboard Setup
```bash
# In another terminal...
cd /Users/srivardhanreddygutta/Projects/AI-code-review-assistant/dashboard

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Run dashboard
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Why You're Seeing Errors

Your VS Code is checking for imports **before** packages are installed. Once you install them, the errors disappear:

```
Project Created
     ↓
Files Written (no packages yet)
     ↓
Pylance/TypeScript checks files
     ↓
Shows "import not found" errors ← YOU ARE HERE
     ↓
Install packages (pip install / npm install)
     ↓
Errors disappear ← YOUR GOAL
     ↓
Code runs fine
```

## ✅ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Read this file
- [ ] Choose Option 1 (Docker) or Option 2 (Manual)
- [ ] Run the commands
- [ ] Wait for services to start
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:8000/docs
- [ ] Errors should be gone! 🎉

## 🐳 Docker Quick Reference

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# See logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d

# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps
```

---

## 🛠️ Manual Installation Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: python3"
Use `python` instead:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### "pg_config executable not found"
This happens when trying to install `psycopg2` without PostgreSQL. Use Docker or install PostgreSQL locally.

### npm permission errors
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
npm install
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :8000

# Kill it
kill -9 <PID>
```

---

## 🎯 After Installation - What to Do

### 1. Verify Backend is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","service":"AI Code Review Assistant API"}
```

### 2. Visit API Documentation
Open: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 3. Visit Dashboard
Open: http://localhost:3000

### 4. Check All Services
```bash
docker-compose ps
# or
docker ps
```

---

## 📚 Next Steps After Setup

1. **Read:** [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md)
2. **Explore:** [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)
3. **Understand:** [docs/API.md](./docs/API.md)
4. **Build:** [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

## 💡 Important Notes

✅ **These errors are expected** - Fresh projects always have missing imports until packages are installed

✅ **Docker is the easiest way** - No manual package management

✅ **All services will work together** - Backend can talk to ML, Dashboard to Backend, etc.

✅ **You can develop in one service** - Change backend files, Flask auto-reloads, no need to reinstall

## 🆘 Still Getting Errors?

### Check if Docker is actually installing packages:
```bash
docker-compose logs backend | grep -i "pip install"
docker-compose logs ml-service | grep -i "pip install"
```

### Check Python version (for manual setup):
```bash
python3 --version
# Should be 3.10+
```

### Verify pip is working:
```bash
python3 -m pip --version
```

### Try fresh install:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
